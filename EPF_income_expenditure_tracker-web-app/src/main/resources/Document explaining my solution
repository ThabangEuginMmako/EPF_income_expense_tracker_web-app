The HTML code is for a form that takes customer information including first name, last name, date of birth, and an Excel file. The form uses the CSS file "style.css" for styling and the JavaScript libraries XLSX and CanvasJS for reading Excel files and rendering charts, respectively. The form will submit the customer information and render a chart in the "chartContainer" div. The chart rendering is controlled by the JavaScript file "app.js".
The CSS code styles the HTML form and chart on the page. The body has a font-family of Arial and padding of 20px. The header has text-align of center and a margin-bottom of 30px. The form has a display of flex, flex-direction of column, and align-items of center, with a margin-bottom of 30px. The labels have a margin-bottom of 10px. The text, date, and file inputs have a padding of 10px, font-size of 16px, and width of 300px. The submit button has a margin-top of 20px, padding of 10px 20px, background-color of #007bff, color of white, no border, and a cursor of pointer. The chart has a height of 500px and width of 100%.
The JavaScript code creates a temporal chart using CanvasJS. The code listens for a form submission event and when the form is submitted, the uploaded Excel file is read using the FileReader API. The Excel data is then converted to JSON format using the XLSX library and passed to the renderChart function. The renderChart function processes the data and adds it to the chartData array, which is then used as the data source for the chart. The chart is then rendered using CanvasJS.
